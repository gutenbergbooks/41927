<h2>GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>


<p>We feel assured that a long introduction is neither
requisite to the reader or publisher of a Work like
the present, and shall, therefore, merely say, that the
great success our former little Works have met with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
has induced us to send forth this edition, in which will
be found every particular connected with this very useful
source of amusement and fashionable department of
<em>practical art</em>. The illustrations are furnished by a late
pupil of the School of Design, who obtained the highest
prize for Flower Painting, assisted by a student of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Academy of Arts</span>. Every example given has
been practically tested, and, in most instances, the drawings
have been copied from the models executed in leather,
and will be found to combine durability with beauty of
design. In order to make the leather modelling as
durable as possible, we have not departed from nature in
the finished form, but in the mode of construction; for
example, we make several portions of a flower in one
piece of leather. The Narcissus and the beautiful White
Lily have each six petals; in both instances, we make
the entire corolla of the flowers in one piece; thereby,
while losing none of the beauty of the natural form of
the flowers, we gain strength and solidity; as, were the
petals of the Lily or Narcissus to be composed of six
pieces, one, if imperfectly cemented, might fall off and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
detract from the beauty of the entire piece of work. By
our method of proceeding, it is impossible to do so: we
mention this, as, in our description of Making and
Modelling Flowers in Leather, we differ from the literally
botanic construction, while, at the same time, we arrive
at perfectly correct and artistic formation.</p>

<p>In some flowers, as in the Hop, Dahlia, &amp;c., we have
found it impracticable to combine many petals in one
piece of leather; where this is the case, especial care
must be taken to have good liquid glue, and fasten each
petal securely.</p>

<p>All leather to be used in Modelling Leaves, Flowers,
&amp;c., must be first wetted, and modelled while wet; and
as this is a general rule, the student will understand that
mention of the necessity of this operation will not in
every instance be repeated.</p>

<p>Amongst the many uses to which Leather Work is
applied, that of ornamenting Pulpits will be found a
capital field for the display of this art, as it is capable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
being moulded into any form, and nothing can possibly
have a more substantial and beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>Glasses of varied form, as jelly glasses and old-fashioned
goblets, as well as many of modern manufacture,
can be covered on the outside with Leather Work.
Lilies of the Valley, and other such flowers, being
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'trailled'">trailed</ins> round a groundwork of leaves, and being either
gilded or stained, look exceedingly well; and as they
are capable of holding water, become really useful as
well as ornamental articles for bouquets of flowers.</p>

<p>Fire-screens and scroll work are executed exactly in
the same manner, as described in the following pages,
for frames. Fire-screens are generally filled with Berlin
wool, or some other fancy work. Those who would
prefer to have an entire piece of Leather Work, can
paint landscapes or flowers upon white leather, using
the same medium which is used at the School of Design
for body colour painting, mixed with finely powdered
colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span></p>

<p>Gold Leather Work looks remarkably well upon a
blue or crimson velvet ground, and makes very rich
frames, fire screens, &amp;c. When tastefully arranged, the
flowers and leaves upon these grounds have a very magnificent
appearance.</p>

<p>Amongst the numerous articles which admit of being
ornamented with leather, may be enumerated frames,
brackets, vases, pole and hand screens, card plates and
racks, music and watch stands.</p>

<h2>LEATHER.</h2>


<p>The kind of leather used for general purposes is basil;
it should be selected of an even texture and of a light
colour, as the lighter coloured basil takes the oak varnish
stain better than the dark.</p>

<p>Great care must be taken to select it soft and free
from blemishes, as if dark and rough leather is used, the
work when finished, even by skilful hands, will not have
so good an appearance as the production of much less
skilful artists, where good basil leather is used.</p>

<p>The skiver leather is used for making grapes, or very
small leaves and flowers, and can be obtained at the
same place as the basil leather; this kind is also very
useful for thin stems and any minute portion of the
work.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>




<h2>DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING THE LEAVES.</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="no_1">
<img src="images/i_013.png" width="300" height="221" alt="Pattern for making leaves." />
<span class="caption">No. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>Sketch, either from nature, or from the <a href="#no_1">example</a>
annexed, the leaf you intend to copy, upon pasteboard;
cut it out very carefully; then place a piece of basil in
<em>cold</em> water for half a minute (not longer), unless the
leather is unusually thick; the leather should then be
taken out of the water, and pressed in a linen cloth until
the surface becomes dry. Being thus prepared, lay
it quite flat and place upon it the pasteboard pattern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
holding it firmly down with the left hand, while with
the right, draw a line round the pattern with a fine hard
black lead pencil or the veining tool: while the leather
is damp cut out the leaf with a pair of scissors or with
the leather-cutting knife, as occasion may require; when
smaller or larger leaves are required, a reduced, or
enlarged, sketch should be taken, a pattern made of it in
pasteboard, and applied in the same manner as described
above, cutting out as many leaves as you require, and
generally making about four sizes of them, as varying
the sizes of the leaves adds much to the beauty of the
foliage. Leaves all the same size would have a very
formal appearance, as they must be veined before they
are allowed to dry; too much leather must not be
wetted at a time, nor more leaves cut out than can be
veined. To vein the leaves, mark them with the veining
tool on the smooth side of the leather strongly, by
pressing heavily on the leaf, where a thick vein is
required; and more lightly where only finer ones should
be visible; for raised veins employ the end of a fine pair
of scissors for the large, and a hard steel pen for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
smaller veins. Being veined, the leaves should be
bent and moulded as they are to appear upon the work
when it is completed: they should then be dried rather
quickly, as it greatly assists in the hardening.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_015.png" width="200" height="242" alt="Decoration" />
</div>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>




<h2>TO HARDEN THEM.</h2>


<p>When the leaves are thoroughly dry, brush them all
over, particularly the edges with the prepared stiffening,
applying it with a camel’s hair pencil, nimbly, as it dries
very rapidly, apply it thin and evenly, taking care to
cover the edges; when dry, they will be ready for
staining.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>




<h2>TO STAIN THEM.</h2>


<p>Pour a little oak varnish stain into a small vessel, and
brush the leaves all over, using a hog’s-hair tool for
the purpose of laying on the stain, taking care to cover
the edges, and brush it well out of the veined parts;
should the leaves, when dry, not be so dark as desired,
another coat can be given, but in no instance apply
thick coats of stain, it will, if put on thick, most likely
dry darker in one place than another, and will never
have so smooth an appearance as when two thin coats
have been applied; take care always that one coat must
be dry before another is applied.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>




<h2>TO MAKE STEMS.</h2>


<p>Cut strips of basil leather about one-third of an inch
wide and as long as the leather will allow; soak them
well in water for a few minutes until they feel very soft,
take them out, wipe the water from the surface, then
roll them round as tightly as possible (the smooth side
outwards) on a table or any even surface, and dry them;
if required very stiff, add inside a piece of wire; when
very thick ones are required the leather must be proportionately
wider.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>




<h2>TO MAKE TENDRILS.</h2>


<p>Tendrils are made in the same manner as Stems,
using skiver instead of basil leather, dry them quickly, and
they will then be ready for use in the following manner:
take a tendril, damp it and immediately wind it round
a bradawl or a piece of stout wire, taking care to fasten
both ends of the tendril so that it does not fly off; dry
it by the fire, then remove it from the awl and a delicately-formed
tendril will be the result; arrange it and
cut to length and form wished, and apply a coat of
stiffening to keep it in shape. Stems and tendrils are to
be hardened and stained precisely in the same manner as
the leaves.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>




<h2>GRAPES.</h2>


<p>In order to produce grapes symmetrically formed a
proper mould should be obtained; then cut rounds of
skiver leather the size required, which must be wetted
and placed in the mould the smooth side downwards;
then fill the leather in the mould firmly with wadding,
and tie the grapes securely with strong thread or fine
twine; when the grape is finished, put a piece of wire
through the part where it has been tied up to form a stalk.
Or grapes can be made of deal or any soft wood with
a hole pierced through the centre large enough to admit
of a leather or gutta percha stalk being drawn through
and fastened at one end; they should now be stained
and made into clusters; wooden grapes may be covered
with damp skiver leather if preferred; it is necessary to
observe, in making the clusters that the tying should be
entirely concealed; all fruit and flowers must be stained,
&amp;c., precisely in the same manner as leaves.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>




<h2>TO ORNAMENT A FRAME.</h2>


<p>Procure a deal frame of the size and form required,
taking care to have it made of well-seasoned wood. Size
it all over with patent size. Leave it about an hour to
dry, then apply a coating of oak varnish stain, and when
dry it will be ready for use. Commence the process of
covering by attaching the stem with small tacks all
round, in spaces of a few inches, in a zigzag direction.
Supposing the vine pattern frame is selected, cover the
wood with four or five gradations of foliage, well arranged,
so as to preserve as nearly as possible, the
natural appearance of the vine. Too great a profusion of
grapes should be avoided; but as the number and size
of the clusters can hardly be determined, we must therefore
leave it to the taste of the artist.</p>

<p>Common pins can be used with advantage in keeping
in its proper place that portion of the work where glue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
only can be applied for the permanent fastening. When
the work becomes firmly attached, the pins can either be
withdrawn, or they can be cut off, close to the ornaments,
with the nippers.</p>

<h2>THE PROPER KIND OF FRAMES TO PROCURE.</h2>

<span class="caption">No. 2.</span>
</div>

<p>The frames best adapted for the work, we have found
to be those levelled off on the outer edge to about half
an inch thinner than the inner, and formed as shewn in
<a href="#no_2">Fig. 1</a>. Frames made in this shape greatly increase the
beauty of the entire design. A narrow gold beading we
have generally added inside, as the gold gives a more
finished appearance to the frame.</p>

<h2>WATCH STANDS,</h2>


<p>Can, like one below, be made by every carpenter; they
must be strong to bear the nailing and gluing on of the
leather ornaments. The design here given (<a href="#no_3">Fig. 2</a>), we
keep, as well as other descriptions in stock, but they can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
be varied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>; and we shall be happy to make
any design to order very promptly, or, as we have before
observed, almost any carpenter can make them, if furnished
with a drawing to work from.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE LILY.</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;" id="no_4">
<img src="images/i_026.png" width="200" height="485" alt="Sketch of lily." />
<span class="caption">No. 4.</span>
</div>

<p>This beautiful flower, one of the oldest inhabitants of
the flower garden, has six petals, which are formed of
one piece of leather, as in <a href="#no_4">Fig. 1</a>; the three largest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
petals, which, alternate with the others, are brought
uppermost, while the three smaller ones are placed
behind. Our readers will at once perceive what is meant
by referring to the finished flower; they are to be veined
and curled as in the natural flower, and the petals will
require to be glued to keep them in their proper places;
it is necessary, if you have not our mould for that purpose,
to adapt something to place the lily upon while
modelling it, as near the shape of the interior of the
flower as possible. The lily has six stamina, with
oblong anthers, which are made in the manner described
for the convolvulus; the pistil, with its swollen base or
germen, lengthened style and heart-shaped stigma,
should be carefully imitated from nature, being a very
prominent feature in the flower; the stamina should be
placed round the germen of the pistil and fastened with
liquid glue into the centre of the flower; it must be recollected
that the smooth side of the leather must be
inside the lily as in the convolvulus; some flowers
require the smooth side of the leather inside, and some
outside; it must depend upon whether the interior or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
exterior of the flower is most in sight, and in some
instances in the same flower some petals must be placed
one way, and some another.</p>

<p>The bud of the lily is formed by merely folding the
whole corolla together veined.</p>

is made with one piece of leather cut as in the accompanying
(<a href="#no_5">Fig. 1</a>). The petals within this are four, and
are cut out, the four in one piece; in the form of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
dotted line, in <a href="#no_5">Fig. 1</a>, they <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'mnst'">must</ins> be moulded into shape
and glued to the stamina inside the calyx so as to alternate
with its petals. This flower belongs to the class
Enneandria, having nine stamina; they are to cut in one
piece of leather. To put the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fuschia'">fuchsia</ins> together, proceed as
follows:&mdash;Cut the nine stamina, and attach to them the
wire, to form the stalk; then roll the four petals firmly
over the stamina; they must be moulded and glued
round the stamina and stalk, then take the calyx and
roll round the whole; the leaves must be expanded and
moulded as in the engraving, taking care that the
stamina are left out as in the natural flower, and that
the inner petals alternate with the leaves of the calyx;
to make the buds, roll up the calyx, and turn the ends
in, not inserting any stamina.</p>

</div>

<p>The beauty of a bracket depends entirely upon the
artistic skill displayed in ornamenting it. The <a href="#no_6">engraving</a>
here given is to illustrate the form of bracket
best suited to give it strength and solidity, and to aid
the artist in bringing the work well out, the strips of
wood on each side of the piece in the centre will be
found exceedingly useful to nail and glue the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
upon; they must be entirely covered with the foliage;
the centre piece can be hidden or not to suit the design;
the appearance of brackets are much improved by having
the edge of the upper part gilded.</p>

<h2>TO MAKE THE CONVOLVULUS FLOWERS.</h2>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;" id="no_7">
<img src="images/i_033.png" width="250" height="335" alt="Sketch of convolvulus." />
<span class="caption">No. 7.</span>
</div>

<p>The Convolvulus, termed, by Botanists, Monopetalous,
from its being composed of only one petal, is exceedingly
well adapted for leather work; it is made by cutting a
half circle of leather with a little piece cut out of the centre
of the diameter, as seen in the annexed engraving (<a href="#no_7">Fig. 1</a>).
The leather so cut must be wetted and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'viened'">veined</ins>, then bent
round (the smooth side inside, so that the smooth side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of the leather form the inside of the flowers) until the
two edges on each side of the notch come together, where
they are to be joined by being either stitched or glued
together; it will then have a conical shape, and must be
moulded with the fingers, or the mould, until it assumes
a natural appearance; the top can be cut to shape, and
that part is finished; cut the stamina, as in (<a href="#no_7">Fig. 2</a>),
leaving a stalk of leather attached to it in the following
manner:&mdash;take a piece of basil about a quarter of an inch
wide and a few inches long; cut the top as in <a href="#no_7">Fig. 2</a>,
taking care to preserve the form of the anther at the top
of each stamen, and rolling the stalk part up, put it
through the petal and glue it in its proper place. The
calyx has five leaves (<a href="#no_7">Fig. 3</a>), and is cut in one piece of
leather; a hole is made in the centre, it is strung on the
stalk and attached with glue to the bottom of the flower
outside as in the finished flower (<a href="#no_7">Fig. 4</a>), so that the
perfect convolvulus is composed of three pieces, the petal
forming the body of the flower, the stamina inside, and
the calyx at the bottom of the flower outside.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>




<h2>THE CONVOLVULUS ANOTHER WAY.</h2>


<p>Another way to make the Convolvulus is to cut a round
piece of leather the size of the flower required, and while
wet, moulding it over the mould for that purpose and
bending it into shape; the Canterbury bell can be formed
of one piece of leather in the same manner, cutting the
top into proper shape with a pair of scissors.</p>

<h2>HOPS.</h2>

<span class="caption"><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fig.'">No.</ins> 8.</span>
</div>

<p>The Hop consists of numerous membraneous scales
having the fruit within, and at their base; with the fruit
however we have nothing to do, as it is out of sight.
The membraneous scales are the petals of the flower,
and in the engraving (<a href="#no_8">Fig. 1</a>), are twenty in number;
they are all the same size, and are cut out of skiver
leather, the shape of the single petal (<a href="#no_8">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>To make the Hop, proceed as follows:&mdash;Take a piece
of wire and wind leather round the end of it, as in <a href="#no_8">Fig. 3</a>,
fastening it well with liquid glue; this inner body should
be somewhat shorter than the Hop is to be when completed,
and pointed at both ends. Cut out as many
petals as are requisite, and mould them into a convex
form at the end of each petal, then glue them alternately,
commencing at the bottom and finishing at the top of the
flowers.</p>

<h2>PASSION FLOWER.</h2>


<p>The Passion Flower is composed in leather of five
pieces, and when well made presents a very beautiful
specimen of what can be accomplished in that material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;" id="no_9">
<img src="images/i_038.png" width="250" height="239" alt="Sketch of calyx and corolla of passion flower." />
<span class="caption">No. 9.</span>
</div>

<p>In making the Passion Flower cut out the calyx of five
leaves&mdash;that is the part of the drawing in the annexed
<a href="#no_9">diagram</a> with the pointed end; then cut out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
corolla of five petals with the rounded ends; cut
also a circular piece for the <a href="#no_10">nectary</a>, which must be
cut all round with the knife to form the radii,
the centre having many small cuts radiating from the
central point; when turned upward, in putting it in
its place, forms the fringe-like appearance around the
pistil seen in the flowers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;" id="no_10">
<img src="images/i_039.png" width="200" height="199" alt="Sketch of nectary of passion flower." />
<span class="caption">No. 10.</span>
</div>

<p>The Passion Flower has five <a href="#no_11">stamina</a> with ladle-shaped
ends, or anthers, and three stigmas a little elevated above
and turning over the stamina; the anthers and stigma
are made of one piece of leather. The involucrum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
is formed also of one piece, and the three leaves
are laid one over the other as in the annexed flower.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;" id="no_11">
<img src="images/i_040.png" width="300" height="417" alt="Sketch of stamina and involucrum of passion flower." />
<span class="caption">No. 11.</span>
</div>

<p>To put together the various parts above described and
form the Passion Flower, begin by doubling a piece of
wire over the angles of the stamina, twisting it underneath;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
roll a piece of skiver leather round the wire to
form the style of the pistil and the stem of the whole
flower; then turn up the three stigmas and roll a small
piece of leather round them close to the stamina and
turn them over; this being done, place the nectary on
the stem, taking care that the cut portion in the centre
be arranged upwards around the pistil. The petals are
next placed on the stem, followed by the calyx; the
leaves of the calyx must alternate with the petals; liquid
glue must be inserted between each portion of the flower
to give it firmness.</p>

<p>The involucrum, which is a sort of calyx, is put on
the stem last a little way below the true calyx; we may
just add, that all the leaves, petals, &amp;c., with the exception
of the involucrum, must have the smooth side of the
leather uppermost; the petals and calyx must be hollowed
out with the modelling tool for that purpose, or if that is
not at hand, use the handle of the veining tool, and laying
the petals and also the calyx on a smooth surface,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
rub them with the ivory end of the veining tool till they
become hollow and smooth as in the natural flower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<p>The above is the way, as plainly as we can possibly
describe it, to make a <a href="#no_12">Passion Flower</a>. We have repeatedly
made the flower exactly upon the above plan, and it
has always been much admired.</p>

</div>

<p>Camillas vary in the form of leaves, and the petals
vary in number. To make a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'camillia'">camilla</ins>, cut out two pieces,
as in the annexed <a href="#no_13">diagram</a>, containing four petals in
each; then cut out one or two larger pieces, with six
petals in each, and one or more still larger, with seven
or eight petals; then, having a natural camilla at hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
mould them all into form, fasten all the pieces of leather
together, the smallest at the top, and the largest at the
bottom, so that the petals alternate, with liquid glue,
and put a piece of wire through the whole for the stalk;
cover it with skiver leather.</p>

</div>

<p>To make the Jessamine, copy the corolla from the
annexed <a href="#no_14">design</a>, by cutting a star-like piece of basil, into
which insert the wire for the stalk as closely as possible.
As the stamina are not visible in this flower, it is needless
to make them. The tube upon which the corolla rests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
can be made by rolling a piece of leather round the wire
thickest at the flower, and then add another piece of
leather about an inch below the corolla, which must have
five fine pointed leaves for the calyx.</p>

golden centre of the daisy, can be well imitated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>

<span class="caption">No. 16.</span>
</div>

<p>A Wild Rose is made by cutting out two pieces of
leather, exactly as in the <a href="#no_16">engraving</a>, putting the wire
through two holes made in the centre of the pieces with
a fine bradawl, and pass a piece of wire through the
holes, leaving both ends of the wire at the back to be
twisted for the stalk. To form the stamina, cut fine
strips of leather as long again as the stamina are required
to be, and insert them under the eye of the wire which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
forms the stalk; then cut the stamina, and pinch them up
into form; the top piece, containing five petals, must
be moulded and curved upward, inclosing the stamina;
the bottom piece also, containing five petals, must be
moulded downwards, curving and bending them into
form.</p>

<p>To make a larger Rose, cut out a smaller piece than
is shewn in the engraving, of the same form, also the two
in the engraving, and a larger piece of the same form
making four pieces, containing twenty petals; then
proceed as before-mentioned, and a fuller Rose is produced;
thus the character of the flower and the number
of petals can be regulated with comparative ease.</p>

<p>The rose leaves can be moulded at the back by
pressing them into the grape mould with one of the
pressing tools.</p>

<p>The Bracket <a href="#no_17">annexed</a> is out of the usual run of
brackets which have generally been ornamented with
leather work. The vine and the convolvulus pattern
are much used with very beautiful effect. We intended
this design to exhibit old oak: it should be stained very
dark, the oak stems being very thick, while the stems of
ivy can be formed of tendrils. To make the oak stems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
get very thick wire, and have it cut to the desired
lengths, then cover the wires with leather, and bend
them to resemble knarled oak; attach, as naturally as
possible, oak leaves and acorns at the back of the wires,
and on the wood work as shewn in the skeleton bracket
in a former part of this work; then attach the ivy
tendrils, leaves, and berries around the oak stems, and
the bracket is completed.</p>

<p>We have found it much improves the appearance of
any piece of work we have been ornamenting, to give
the whole when completed a slight coat of varnish.</p>

<h2>THE ROUND OPEN WORK FRAME.</h2>


<p>The beautiful design in the <a href="#no_20">accompanying page</a> is
made with a round frame of any width desired, having
two rebates, one inside and one outside the frame&mdash;the
inside rebate being to admit the picture, and the outside
one to allow of the nailing firmly to the frame the open
work, which is to be made in the following manner:&mdash;Take
a flat board, an ironing board will do, lay the frame
upon it, and with a black lead pencil or a piece of chalk,
mark the size all round, making allowance for the
rebate; then having ready the stems, work them in and
out, so as to form the open work as in the drawing;
when finished, nail it to the frame, and work stems and
tendrils of the vine, hop, passion flower, or any other
beautiful creeping plant, attaching the fruit or flowers in
an artistic manner, and the result will be one of the
most elegant frames ever beheld.</p><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span></p>

<p>The open or trellis work of this frame should have
stout wire enclosed in the basil leather, and in order that
it may not appear formal, wind pieces of leather round the
naked wire at irregular intervals to resemble knots, &amp;c.
then cover the whole with basil leather,&mdash;the stem and
tendrils which are to wind in and out, and are a portion
of the plant, are not to have wire in them.</p>

<p>Fire Screens are generally filled with Berlin wool,
or some other fancy needlework. Those who would
prefer to have an entire piece of leather work can
paint landscapes or flowers upon white leather, using the
same medium as is used in body colour painting at the
School of Design, mixed with finely powdered colours.</p>

<h2>TO MAKE ACORNS.</h2>


<p>Acorns can be made in the following manner. Procure
some natural acorn-cups (which are to be found in great
quantities in the autumn), choose such cups only as are
perfectly sound; then pierce two holes through the
bottom of the cup, pass a piece of fine wire through the
holes, leaving the two ends long enough to be twisted
into a stalk; if the stalk is to be exposed, it must be
covered with skiver and made fast with Shaw’s liquid
glue. The most correctly-formed acorn tops are those
turned in wood, which can be firmly placed in the cup
by the aid of the liquid glue; this completes the fully-formed
acorn.</p>

work, properly speaking; or fruit may be moulded in

<h2>TO MAKE STIFFENING WHICH IS NOT
AFFECTED BY DAMP.</h2>


<p>Mix, cold, 2 oz. of Australian red gum, 6 oz. of
orange shellac, &frac12; pint spirits of wine; put all into a
bottle, and shake it up occasionally till the gums are
dissolved; strain, and it is fit for use. This is far
preferable to the above size, as it is more hardening,
dries quicker, is always ready for use, and is never
affected by damp in change of weather.</p>

<h2>TO MAKE MAHOGANY VARNISH STAIN,
WHICH DRIES IN A FEW MINUTES.</h2>


<p>Mix, cold, &frac34; lb. Australian red gum, &frac14; lb. garnet
shellac, 1 pint spirits of wine; put them in a bottle, and
shake occasionally, till the gum is dissolved; strain,
and it is fit for use. The above makes a capital varnish
for leather of all kinds, especially for the leather covers
of old books; it preserves them, and gives an appearance
almost equal to new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>




<h2>SPIRIT OAK VARNISH STAIN</h2>


<p>Can be made by adding to the above mahogany stain,
a small portion of vegetable black, and shaking it up till
well incorporated. To use the spirit oak stain on larger
surfaces we have found it preferable to apply it in the
same manner as a French polish&mdash;namely, let all dirt
and wax be perfectly rubbed off with fine glass paper, till
quite smooth, then make a flannel rubber in the form
of a printer’s dabber, put a little stain on the dabber,
and put a clean calico rag over it; apply a little linseed
oil, with your finger, to the calico, and commence rubbing
over a small space, in a circular direction (never
suffering the rubber to remain on any part), till you feel
it become tacky, then apply a little more oil, and so
on, till the stain on the rubber is exhausted. Should
the stain become too thick to work freely, add a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
drops of spirits of wine, and shake it well together.
When you have raised a fine polish over the surface, let
it remain a few hours to harden, then take a clean bit of
calico, and just damp it with spirits of wine, rub it
lightly over the surface in a circular direction, which,
repeated two or three times, will clear off all smears, and
leave the most beautiful gloss ever seen.</p>

<p>In this latter process of finishing off, you must be
cautious not to damp the rag too much, for that would
instantly destroy all the polish; also, to change the rag
often, and not suffer it to remain on any part. For
carved work it is only necessary to clean it as before
directed, and apply the stain with a camel’s-hair brush,
by a gentle fire, letting it dry between each application.</p>

<p>The best oak varnish stain is that made with asphaltum;
but, as the manufacturing is attended with great
danger, we think it best not to give the particulars; and
it can be procured cheaper than it could be made in small
quantities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>




<h2>TO PRESERVE LEAVES AND KEEP THEM IN
FORM FOR IMITATION.</h2>


<p>Procure 1 lb. or more of white starch powder, dry it
well in an open dish before the fire, put it on one
side to cool, when quite cool, put a layer of half an inch
at the bottom of a small box, observing that the box
also is dry; gather the leaves, if possible, on a fine
summer day, and lay as many leaves gently on the
starch powder at the bottom of the box as can be done
without interfering with each other, then sprinkle starch
powder over them, and shake it down so that the powder
settles all round above and below the leaves until they
are completely covered, and about half an inch of the
starch powder above them, then put another layer of
leaves, and proceed with the starch powder as before
until the box is filled, then press the top part, quite full
of starch powder, fastening the lid of the box firmly
down until the leaves are required. Ferns and flat leaves
can be preserved by placing them between sheets of
blotting paper under a weight.</p>

<h2>TO GILD LEATHER WORK.</h2>


<p><i>The materials necessary for gilding of this kind are</i>&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>A Gilder’s Knife.</li>
<li>A Gilder’s Cushion.</li>
<li>Some Gold Leaf.</li>
<li>A little Cotton Wool.</li>
<li>A few Camel’s Hair Pencils.</li>
<li>One or two Hog’s Hair Tools.</li>
<li>A Tip.</li>
<li>Oil Gold Size.</li>
<li>Fat Oil.</li>
<li>Drying Oil, and a</li>
<li>Burnishing Stone.</li>
</ul>

<p>They cost only a few shillings, and with care last a
very long time.</p><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<p>Size the wood work twice over with parchment size,
cut all the leaves, and make the flowers in the usual manner;
size them all over twice with parchment size; nail them
down to the frame, and glue them when tacks would look
unsightly: needle points are very useful in this work to
secure it firmly, and cut them short off when the glued
parts are dry&mdash;all the flowers and leaves being attached,
go over the entire work again with parchment size very
thinly; the parchment size must be used warm; when
the size is dry, mix well in a cup or any clean earthen
vessel about an ounce of oil gold size, and with equal
parts of fat oil and drying oil thin the gold size to
the consistence of cream; take a hog’s-hair tool, and with
it brush equally and very thinly all over every part that
can be seen with this prepared gold size, set it on one
side for an hour or two or more, until it has become
almost dry, and just sticks to your fingers when touched:
it must now be gilded all over, and to do this, take a
book of gold, handling it quietly, and mind there is no
draft, as a current of air would blow all the gold away:
turn out of the book two or three leaves of gold upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the cushion, and blow gently upon the centre of each
leaf, to make them lay flat on the cushion; with the
gilder’s knife cut the gold leaves into the sizes required
to cover the work, and with the tip <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'or'">of</ins> the gilder’s knife
take up the gold from the cushion and lay it all over the
frame till it is covered, pressing the gold down with a large
camel hair tool or a piece of cotton wool, taking care not
to rub it backward or forward, but to put it very straight
down on to the work; should there be any holes left,
cut small pieces of gold leaf and lay over them, pressing
the gold down, proceeding in the above manner till the
frame is covered all over with gold; it must then be left
to dry an hour or two, and when dry brush all the loose
gold off with a large camel hair or badger’s hair tool,
and the gilding is completed. Leather work gilded by
the above process will bear washing, and is the most
durable kind of gilding known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>




<h2>TO BURNISH GOLD.</h2>


<p>Acorns and any wooden part attached to leather work
can be burnished, which adds much to the variety of the
work, and is done in the following manner:&mdash;that part
of the work intended to be burnished must be prepared
exactly as above, except that instead of using the prepared
oil gold size take the white of an egg and give the
work a coat of it, let it dry, then give it another coat,
and when nearly dry see that it lays on evenly; apply
the gold leaf all over; leave it an hour or two to become
hard; then burnish it by rubbing it all over with a burnishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
stone or any very hard and perfectly smooth
substance. This burnish gilding is far more brilliant
than the oil gold, but will not wash, and is not so
durable.</p>

<h2>BEE HIVES.</h2>


<p>Bee Hives can be made with leather stems, as follows:&mdash;Cut
a piece of wood to the shape and size required;
wind and glue upon it the stems, beginning at the top,
and finishing off at the bottom. To join the stems as
you proceed, cut each end to an angle, so that they fit;
join them with liquid glue, and tie a piece of thread round
to hold them tightly together until the glue is dry.
When the hive is completed, that portion of thread left
visible can be cut off.</p>

<p>To imitate the tying seen in hives, mark with a pen,
or a camel’s hair pencil, with the darkest stain, lines and
dots from top to bottom; cut a small piece out of the
lower tier to make the entrance, and put a little handle
at the top with a piece of stem.</p><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span></p>

<p>When made as above, on wood, and well glued, they
can be sawn in halves, thus making two. Placed amongst
foliage, frames, &amp;c., they are quite in keeping, and have
a pleasing effect.</p>

<h2>TO PAINT ORNAMENTAL LEATHER WORK.</h2>


<p>Use finely powdered colours, and mix them to the
consistence of cream, with the following medium:&mdash;Mix
the white of an egg with 2 oz. of pure distilled vinegar;
put them into a bottle and shake them well together
whenever you are about to mix any colours with it: or
mix the colours with parchment size warmed; use while
warm: or mix them with a weak solution of gum arabic;
and, in either case, varnish them with a quick drying
pale varnish. Oil colours will not do for painting this
kind of materials: any of the above mediums, properly
prepared, will answer well. Gilding may be interspersed
with brilliant effect.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span></p>




<h2>A QUICK MODE OF STAINING.</h2>


<p>The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'qucikest'">quickest</ins> mode of staining the Ornamental Leather
Work is as follows:&mdash;Procure a bottle of <span class="smcap">Revell’s
Chymical Oak Colour Stain</span>. This preparation will
not soil the hands, or the finest linen or woollen fabrics;
will not stain wood or any other substance than the
leather to which it is applied, to which it imparts the
perfect appearance of old oak without any gloss, at the
same time hardening the leather without injuring it.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>




<h2>DIRECTIONS FOR USE.</h2>


<p>Having your leaves, &amp;c., cut out and dried, pour some
of the contents of this bottle into a saucer, and apply it
copiously with a camel’s hair brush, all over the leaves,
back and front, particularly the edges; bend them while
damp as you wish them to appear upon the finished
work, then dry them rather quickly at a moderate distance
from the fire, or in a current of air; when dry
they are ready for use.</p>

<p>The leaves, &amp;c., can be attached to any form of work,
and it is completed. When the entire work is complete,
it can be varnished at pleasure, as follows:&mdash;Procure a
bottle of <span class="smcap">Revell’s Oak Spirit Stain</span>, and give the
entire work an even coat of it; it dries in a few minutes,
and has the appearance of polished oak.</p>

<hr class="chap noepub" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>




<h2>TO STAIN WOODEN ARTICLES.</h2>


<p>If all the work is to be left dull, give the frame or
bracket, &amp;c., a coat of <span class="smcap">Oak Spirit Stain</span>, which dries
in dull if put upon new wood, not prepared in any manner.
To prepare wooden frames, &amp;c., so that the <span class="smcap">Oak
Spirit Stain</span> shall assume a polished surface, it is
necessary to size the frame well and leave it to dry;
when dry, give it one or more coats of <span class="smcap">Oak Spirit
Stain</span>.</p>

<p>Those who prefer making the <span class="smcap">Oak Spirit Stain</span>, can
do so by referring to the receipt in this book; it is made
with little trouble, and is composed principally of Australian
Red Gum; a new article to most of our readers;
and, although many druggists, &amp;c., have procured it
when they have received orders for it, we are sorry to
say, in several instances, they have said there was no
article of that description; or else have substituted a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
different kind of gum, perfectly <em>worthless for this purpose</em>;
consequently, disappointment has ensued; and in
order to protect the public from being imposed upon,
and ourselves the disgrace of publishing anything not
practicable, we are obliged, in self-defence, to state how
we came to use it.</p>

<p>In the month of January, 1852, the publisher was
applied to for a varnish stain that would dry quickly,
and at the same time be the colour required: he was
making experiments for this purpose, when, taking up
the <span class="smcap">Times</span> newspaper of Friday, January 23rd, he found,
under the heading of <span class="smcap">Society of Arts</span>, an epitome of
Professor <span class="smcap">Edward Solly</span>’s lecture, at the above Society
on the previous Wednesday, on vegetable substances
used in the Arts, &amp;c. Allusions were made to a fine
red gum from New South Wales: he procured the
lecture, and then, after a little trouble, obtained samples;
they were tested, and one was found to answer, and he
has now in stock several tons of the proper kind for
making the stain, and can supply it in any quantity.</p><p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<p>We will now conclude by directing the student to an
attentive observance of nature: we have avoided, as far as
possible, technical terms; where they are used the illustrations
will, in most cases, explain them. The study of
this mode of decoration has often led those who had not
before observed the varied beauties of the floral world to
do so with the greatest pleasure and the happiest
results.</p>
